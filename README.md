## Ford GoBike System Data Exploration
### by Bolu Okelola

## Dataset

This analysis was conducted on a dataset about a bike renting service (Ford GoBike) in the SanFranciso bay area. The users are split between Subscribers (committed riders) and Customers (occasional riders), who used their bikes mostly on the weekdays and weekends respectively.

I carried out an initial wrangling step to:

1. get an overview of the data
2. clean the data to fix data types, remove null values and variables irrelevant to this analysis

## Summary of Findings

1. Ford GoBike had far more subscribers than customers, which resulted in the representation of the former taking more trips (in count)
2. The dataset for February 2019 presents more information about males riders than any other gender
3. The stations on 4th Street seem to be frequented by the users
4. As expected, the peak age amongst its users were between 24-20 years, withe the frequency of trips dropping the older its members got
5. Although sporadically, the duration of trips taken by customers were generally longer.
6. Thursday (mornings and early evenings) had the most usage count, with a major drop during the weekends.
7. Customers seem to have taken the longest trips at the wee hours of the morning.


## Key Insights for Presentation

There are more male susbcribers than any other group, wihin the dataset, resulting in a ***higher count*** of trip. As seen in the visualisation, this does not mean that this set of people took the ***longest*** trips; this prize goes to the customers who did not specify their genders.
These customers took the longest trips at midnight during the weekends
Generally, amongst subscribers, trips were taken more during the weekdays, at rush hours (8am and 5pm)
